				<h3>Feature 1</h3>
				<p>O Meno, there was a time when the Thessalians were famous among the other Hellenes only for their
					riches and their riding; but now, if I am not mistaken, they are equally famous for their wisdom,
					especially at Larisa, which is the native city of your friend Aristippus. And this is Gorgias'
					doing; for when he came there, the flower of the Aleuadae, among them your admirer Aristippus, and
					the other chiefs of the Thessalians, fell in love with his wisdom.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="feature">
				<h3>Feature 2</h3>
				<p>And he has taught you the habit of answering questions in a grand and bold style, which becomes those
					who know, and is the style in which he himself answers all comers; and any Hellene who likes may ask
					him anything. How different is our lot! my dear Meno. Here at Athens there is a dearth of the
					commodity, and all wisdom seems to have emigrated from us to you. I am certain that if you were to
					ask any Athenian whether virtue was natural or acquired, he would laugh in your face, and say:
					"Stranger, you have far too good an opinion of me, if you think that I can answer your question.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="feature">
				<h3>Feature 3</h3>
				<p>For I literally do not know what virtue is, and much less whether it is acquired by teaching or not."
					And I myself, Meno, living as I do in this region of poverty, am as poor as the rest of the world;
					and I confess with shame that I know literally nothing about virtue; and when I do not know the
					"quid" of anything how can I know the "quale"? How, if I knew nothing at all of Meno, could I tell
					if he was fair, or the opposite of fair; rich and noble, or the reverse of rich and noble? Do you
					think that I could?</p>
